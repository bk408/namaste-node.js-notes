🔍 What is V8?
V8 is Google’s high-performance engine for JavaScript and WebAssembly, written in C++. It’s used in Chrome, and Node.js, and can be embedded into any C++ application. Essentially, it translates our JavaScript code into something the computer can understand and execute efficiently.

🛠️ Node.js:
Node.js is written in C++ with V8 embedded, offering superpowers like server APIs and modules.

📜 ECMAScript:
The standard that all JavaScript engines, like V8, follow to ensure compatibility and performance.

🚀 JS Engines:

🔍 V8 => Google
🦊 SpiderMonkey => Firefox
🌐  Chakra => Microsoft
🧭 JavaScriptCore => Safari

💡 Why is V8 written in C++?
As developers, we write code in JavaScript because it’s easier to understand. V8 and other JavaScript engines are written in C++. When we write code in JavaScript, V8 converts the high-level language code into low-level language code—essentially translating JavaScript into machine code and assembly language, then into binary code so the system can understand and execute it.
